CS 370 Pirate Intelligent Agent - Portfolio Reflection
Project Overview
Work Completed on This Project
For this project, I was provided with a foundational framework including the TreasureMaze environment class, GameExperience class for storing episodes, and various helper functions for visualization and game simulation. The starter code included the maze structure, neural network model architecture, and function skeletons.
The core work I completed was implementing the deep Q-learning algorithm in the qtrain() function. This involved:

Creating the main training loop that runs for multiple epochs
Implementing the exploration vs exploitation strategy using epsilon-greedy action selection
Developing the logic for the agent to interact with the environment, collect rewards, and store experiences
Integrating the experience replay mechanism to train the neural network
Adding win rate tracking and completion criteria to determine when the agent has successfully learned optimal pathfinding

The implementation required understanding reinforcement learning concepts, particularly how Q-learning works with neural networks to approximate Q-values for state-action pairs in the maze environment.
Connection to Computer Science
What Computer Scientists Do and Why It Matters
Computer scientists solve complex problems by developing algorithms, systems, and technologies that impact virtually every aspect of modern life. In this project, I applied machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques to create an intelligent agent capable of learning optimal navigation strategies. This type of work has real-world applications in robotics, autonomous vehicles, game development, and resource optimization. Computer scientists bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and practical solutions, creating technologies that improve efficiency, safety, and quality of life.
Problem-Solving Approach as a Computer Scientist
My approach to this reinforcement learning problem followed systematic computer science principles:

Problem Analysis: Understanding the environment, constraints, and objectives of the treasure hunt scenario
Algorithm Selection: Choosing deep Q-learning as the appropriate reinforcement learning technique
Implementation Strategy: Breaking down the complex algorithm into manageable components (exploration, experience replay, neural network training)
Testing and Validation: Using completion checks and win rate metrics to validate the agent's performance
Optimization: Tuning hyperparameters like epsilon, memory size, and training epochs to achieve optimal results

This methodical approach of decomposing complex problems, applying appropriate algorithms, and iteratively refining solutions is fundamental to computer science practice.
Ethical Responsibilities
As a computer scientist developing AI systems, I have several ethical responsibilities:
To End Users: Ensuring the AI agent behaves predictably and safely. In this maze context, the agent should find efficient paths without getting stuck or behaving erratically. In real-world applications, this translates to creating reliable systems that users can trust.
To Organizations: Developing transparent, well-documented code that can be maintained and understood by other developers. The algorithms should be efficient with computational resources and provide clear performance metrics.
Broader Ethical Considerations: Understanding that AI and machine learning systems can have unintended consequences. While this project is educational, the principles apply to more critical applications like autonomous vehicles or medical diagnosis systems, where algorithmic decisions directly impact human safety and well-being.
The reinforcement learning techniques demonstrated here must be applied responsibly, with consideration for fairness, transparency, and potential societal impacts when deployed in real-world scenarios.
